-- CRITICAL PERFORMANCE INDEXES - Week 1 Sprint
-- These indexes fix the major query performance bottlenecks identified in the audit

-- ====================
-- SHOTS TABLE INDEXES
-- ====================

-- Most critical: User shots with time ordering (for dashboard/profile pages)
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_shots_user_created_desc 
ON shots(user_id, created_at DESC) 
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Public shots for leaderboards and feed (heavily queried)
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_shots_public_created_desc 
ON shots(is_public, created_at DESC) 
WHERE is_public = true AND deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Club-specific analysis (for My Bag feature)
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_shots_user_club_distance 
ON shots(user_id, club, distance DESC) 
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Leaderboard queries by club type
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_shots_club_distance_public 
ON shots(club, distance DESC, created_at DESC) 
WHERE is_public = true AND deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Weekly/monthly leaderboards
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_shots_public_weekly 
ON shots(created_at DESC, distance DESC) 
WHERE is_public = true 
  AND deleted_at IS NULL 
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';

-- Distance range queries (for competitions/challenges)
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_shots_distance_range 
ON shots(distance DESC, user_id, created_at DESC) 
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- ====================
-- USERS TABLE INDEXES
-- ====================

-- Email lookups (authentication)
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_email_lower 
ON users(LOWER(email)) 
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Active users for analytics
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_active 
ON users(last_login_at DESC, created_at DESC) 
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Retailer queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_retailer 
ON users(is_retailer, created_at DESC) 
WHERE is_retailer = true AND deleted_at IS NULL;

-- ====================
-- COMPOSITE INDEXES FOR COMPLEX QUERIES
-- ====================

-- Dashboard stats query optimization
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_shots_user_stats 
ON shots(user_id, created_at DESC, distance, club) 
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Leaderboard with user info
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_shots_leaderboard_complete 
ON shots(distance DESC, user_id, club, created_at DESC, is_public) 
WHERE is_public = true AND deleted_at IS NULL;

-- ====================
-- MATERIALIZED VIEWS FOR HEAVY QUERIES
-- ====================

-- Real-time leaderboard materialized view

  AND s.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
  AND u.deleted_at IS NULL
GROUP BY s.user_id, u.name, u.avatar_url, s.club;

-- Index for materialized view
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_mv_leaderboard_max_distance 
ON mv_live_leaderboard(max_distance DESC);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_mv_leaderboard_club_rank 
ON mv_live_leaderboard(club, club_rank);

-- Weekly stats materialized view
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW IF NOT EXISTS mv_weekly_stats AS

    club,
    COUNT(*) as shots_this_week,

GROUP BY user_id, DATE_TRUNC('week', created_at), club;

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_mv_weekly_stats_user_week 
ON mv_weekly_stats(user_id, week_start DESC);

-- ====================
-- QUERY PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS
-- ====================

-- Update table statistics for query planner
ANALYZE shots;
ANALYZE users;

-- Set work_mem for this session (helps with sorting/grouping)
SET work_mem = '256MB';

-- ====================
-- AUTOMATED VIEW REFRESH
-- ====================

-- Function to refresh materialized views

-- ====================
-- PERFORMANCE MONITORING QUERIES
-- ====================

-- View to monitor slow queries
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW v_slow_queries AS
SELECT 
    query,
    calls,
    total_time,
    mean_time,
    rows,
    100.0 * shared_blks_hit / nullif(shared_blks_hit + shared_blks_read, 0) AS hit_percent
FROM pg_stat_statements 
WHERE total_time > 1000  -- queries taking more than 1 second total
ORDER BY total_time DESC;

-- View to monitor index usage
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW v_index_usage AS

    schemaname,
    tablename,
    indexname,
    idx_tup_read,
    idx_tup_fetch,

         WHEN idx_scan < 10 THEN 'LOW USAGE'
         ELSE 'ACTIVE' END as usage_status

ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;

-- EXPECTED PERFORMANCE GAINS
-- ====================

/*
BEFORE OPTIMIZATION:
- Dashboard user stats: 2-5 seconds
- Leaderboard queries: 3-8 seconds  
- My Bag club analysis: 1-3 seconds
- Public feed: 2-4 seconds

AFTER OPTIMIZATION:
- Dashboard user stats: 50-200ms (10-25x faster)
- Leaderboard queries: 100-300ms (15-30x faster)
- My Bag club analysis: 20-100ms (15-30x faster) 
- Public feed: 100-200ms (20x faster)

TOTAL EXPECTED IMPROVEMENT: 15-30x faster queries
